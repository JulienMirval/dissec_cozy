# DISSEC-COZY

## What's DISSEC-COZY?

DISSEC-COZY is a proof-of-concept implementation of DISSEC-ML, the academic work done by Cozy and PETRUS. 

It is a decentralized aggregation protocol designed to be used for privacy-preserving machine learning. Nodes locally learn a model and then use a simple additively homomorphic secret-sharing scheme to send data to aggregators. Aggregators form a tree to maximize efficiency.

## Setup

_:pushpin: Note:_ we recommend to use [Yarn] instead of NPM for package management. Don't hesitate to [install][yarn-install] and use it for your Cozy projects, it's now our main node packages tool for Cozy official apps.

### Install

Setting up the Cozy DISSEC-COZY app requires you to [setup a dev environment][setup].

You can then clone the app repository and install dependencies:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/JulienMirval/dissec_cozy.git
$ cd dissec_cozy
$ yarn install
```

:pushpin: If you use a node environment wrapper like [nvm] or [ndenv], don't forget to set your local node version before doing a `yarn install`.

Cozy's apps use a standard set of _npm scripts_ to run common tasks, like watch, lint, test, buildâ€¦

### Configuration

In order to allow continuous enhancement of performances, nodes in the protocol can start training from a pretrained model, which is the result of the last training. 

Currently, this model is stored on the local file system and the path needs to be defined for the execution to work. In the file `dissec.config.json`, set the `localModelPath` value to a path where you want this shared model to be stored.

### Living on the edge

[Cozy-ui] is our frontend stack library that provides common styles and components accross the whole Cozy's apps. You can use it for you own application to follow the official Cozy's guidelines and styles. If you need to develop / hack cozy-ui, it's sometimes more useful to develop on it through another app. You can do it by cloning cozy-ui locally and link it to yarn local index:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-ui.git
cd cozy-ui
yarn install
yarn link
```

then go back to your app project and replace the distributed cozy-ui module with the linked one:

```sh
cd cozy-drive
yarn link cozy-ui
```

[Cozy-client-js] is our API library that provides an unified API on top of the cozy-stack. If you need to develop / hack cozy-client-js in parallel of your application, you can use the same trick that we used with [cozy-ui]: yarn linking.

### Tests

Tests are run by [jest] under the hood. You can easily run the tests suite with:

```sh
$ cd dissec_cozy
$ yarn test
```

:pushpin: Don't forget to update / create new tests when you contribute to code to keep the app the consistent.

## Demonstration

A test scenario has been developed to test the protocol with multiple instances.
It is currently static and will involves 11 nodes: 7 nodes will contribute a single data to the protocol, 3 nodes will serve as intermediate aggregators and the querier (the default instance of the stack) will act as the querier, creating the tree and triggerring contributors.

The steps to to execute the demonstration are as follows:

1. Have a `build` folder in the in the `dissecozy` repo. For development purposes, you can run a `yarn watch` command, which will look for updates in the repo and automatically build the latest version. Else, run `yarn build`.
2. Launch `cozy-stack serve --disable-csp` to start the stack with the dissecozy app loaded.
3. Create test instances by running `yarn run populate`. This will create the 10 test instances (`test1.cozy.localhost:8080` to `test10.cozy.localhost:8080`) and automatically provide the contributing ones (instances 4-10) with a single, hand craft banking operation. It will also output a JSON file containing all these instances' webhooks, to be used by the querier for creating the tree. The file is located in `assets/webhooks.json`.
4. Open a browser and go to the dissecozy URL of your default instance (e.g. `http://dissecozy.cozy.tools:8080/`)
5. In the *Nodes* section, click the 'Choose a file' button and select the JSON file containing webhooks. Then, click upload to register all the test instances to the querier.
6. Go to the *Execution* section and, in the *Full Aggregation* sub section, first click the 'Generate new tree' button, then 'Launch execution' button.

Congratulations, you launched the execution. After a few seconds, you should see new file created at the location indicated by `localModelPath` value of `dissec.config.json` file.

To verify the correctness of the execution, you can test the following sentences:

- "fruits frais" should be classified as "Supermarket"
- "lait de vach" should be classified as "Supermarket"
- "carte de metro" should be classified as "Transportation"

## Models

The Cozy datastore stores documents, which can be seen as JSON objects. A `doctype` is simply a declaration of the fields in a given JSON object, to store similar objects in an homogeneous fashion.

Cozy ships a [built-in list of `doctypes`][doctypes] for representation of most of the common documents (Bills, Contacts, Files, ...).

DISSEC-COZY uses the following additionnal doctypes:

- `dissec.nodes` is used to register instances willing to participate in the protocol, so that the querier can organize them to create an efficient tree.

[Cozy] is a platform that brings all your web services in the same private space.  With it, your webapps and your devices can share data easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own hardware where no one's tracking you.

### Localization

Localization and translations are handled by [Transifex][tx], which is used by all Cozy's apps.

As a _translator_, you can login to [Transifex][tx-signin] (using your Github account) and claim an access to the [app repository][tx-app]. Locales are pulled when app is build before publishing.

As a _developer_, you must [configure the transifex client][tx-client], and claim an access as _maintainer_ to the [app repository][tx-app]. Then please **only update** the source locale file (usually `en.json` in client and/or server parts), and push it to Transifex repository using the `tx push -s` command.


### Maintainer

The lead maintainer for DISSEC-COZY is [Julien Mirval](https://github.com/JulienMirval), send him/her a :beers: to say hello!
